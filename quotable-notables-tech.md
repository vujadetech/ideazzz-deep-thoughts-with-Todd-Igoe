### Quotable notables, tech version

- There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

	- As good as that quote is, [this version is even better.](https://twitter.com/pbowden/status/468855097879830528)
	
- A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing. -- Alan Perlis
	- I doubt this is even true, but I like it nevertheless.
	

- [Computer science] is not really about computers -- and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes...and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use. -- [Hal Abelson](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)

- Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. -- Fred Brooks
