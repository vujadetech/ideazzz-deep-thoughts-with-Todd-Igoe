#### Geek purgatory: not purely intellectual, but then again not purely funny, so these ~~jokes~~ observations shall languish in geek comedy purgatory [IN PROGRESS]

- The phrase _vacuously true_ is used by mathematicians and others who are mathematically inclined, physicists for example, to indicate that a statement is technically true, but not in an earth-shattering sort of way. A common context is a proof in set theory which must handle the case of a theorem when it's applied to the empty set before moving on to more interesting cases, like [higher order infinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#Continuum_hypothesis). That reminds me, apropos [the controversy that we're leading to](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/entertainment/good-omens-petition-netflix-amazon-trnd/index.html), what did the NYC policeman say after the Crucifixion? "Alright, show's over people. Move along, nothin' to see here ..." But seriously folks,  vacuous cases can - paradoxically - cause considerable confusion. The reason being that any statement which is quantified over the empty set must be true (vacuously) because no counterexample could exist. The set is empty after all; it contains nothing and thus, [a fortiori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_a_fortiori), it contains no counterexample to any statement, however absurd that statement might be. For example, consider the statement,
> All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers.

At first blush, this sounds ridiculous. A number can't be even and odd at the same time. However, that's not what the statement says. There is just one even prime number, namely 2, so the set of all even prime numbers larger than 2 is the empty set. Thus the previous statement reduces to,

> Every member of the empty set is an odd number.

However pointless, that is a true statement. If you believe otherwise, then how would you disprove it? If you can find a member of the empty set that's not an odd number, then you have found a counterexample and you're done. But good luck with that since the empty set has no members at all, so in particular, it has no members about which one could say (truthfully or otherwise) "this is not an odd number." Therefore, the statement "All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers" is true, even if it isn't useful.

A good example of a vacuously true statement "in the wild" was [a tweet from _Netflix_ addressing a petition to cancel _Good Omens_](https://decider.com/2019/06/21/netflix-amazon-respond-good-omens-petition/). The petition was trivial to address. _Netflix_ can easily promise not to make another episode of _Good Omens_ for the (vacuously) true reason that _they never made an episode of it in the first place_ - [it's produced by __Amazon Prime__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMHTRFF)!

- Morrissey cancelled his sold-out concert in Los Angeles, CA upon finding out that the only reason the show sold out is that [he's extremely popular among Latinos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/08/why-do-mexican-americans-love-morrissey-so-much/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.14144eb64aa0). "I don't want to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to perform before throngs of adoring fans just because my angst-ridden lyrical and vocal style surprisingly resonates disproportiantely among Latinos. You should want me for who I am as a person." Concertgoers' concerns were not assuaged when it was announced that instead of issuing refunds, the show would go on as scheduled with headliner Ricky Martin. And yet more bad news in entertainment: David Hasselhoff has cancelled his Germany-only European Tour, since the only reason he's so popular in Germany is that Germans are mysteriously enamored of David Hasselhoff.

- Doubling down! Amidst staunch criticism of President Trump's plan to build a "big, beautiful wall" along the 2000 mile border between the United States and Mexico

Although *Make America Great Again ** Again** then normal* sdfs

sdf *Make America Great Again **Again** c * campaign _

blah *one star **one more** back to one*

Although Mr. Trump's augmented wall/catapult policy is more unrealistic than the already impractal border wall plan which was the foundation of his previous campaign, poll results indicate that this new policy will lead Mr. Trump to an even more decisive victory in the 2020 election than the one he enjoyed in 2016.

- ***Rock the Primary!***

- The NSA and FBI have issued a joint security warning due to an ... which indicate that on February 14, 2020, hundreds of Mexicans are planning to cross the US border and steal Americans' hearts.

- Every year thousands of Mexicans cross the US border and steal jobs from American actors. Whether it . Even worse is Kate Castillo, or should I call her _Señorita Desvergonzada (Miss Shameless)_? 
she's horning in on American journalism as well.
Sean Penn could have interviewed El Chapo with help from an American like Cameron Diaz or John Quiñones\*. If we can't ensure that jobs which entail interviewing the most notorious living leader of a Mexican drug cartel are given to Americans, what hope have we for our economic future?

Every time Kate Castillo is cast in a Hollywood movie, she's taking roles that could have been portrayed by American actresses like Cameron Diaz and Selena Gomez. And for roles that are gender-neutral, American actors like Luis Guzmán, Danny Trujillo and Jimmy Smits. 

\* Fun Fact: [John Quiñones'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What_Would_You_Do%3F_(2008_TV_program)&_%28ABC_News_series%29=) Indian name is [_Hides with Cameras_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves).

- Rap music is running dangerously low on triplets. Although the triplet quota is nearly exhausted, there is still no consensus among rappers, producers/recording engineers and musicians on a solution to the triplet shortage. Producer Rick Rubin has revealed that initial mixes of Kendrick Lamar's forthcoming album, _Tripletless_, sound off because there is an eighth note and two sixteenth notes everywhere that there otherwise would have been a quarter note triplet. In a joint research effort by MIT and Cal Tech, music scientists have devised a method for stemming the depletion of rap's triplets by sampling them from ballroom waltzes, which have an abundance of triplets.

- Situations wanted: Seeking other musicians named Todd to join my _Led Zeppelin_ tribute band _Hammer of the Todds_.

- Tonight the Royal Institute of Philosophy will debate a question which is as incendiary as it is divisive: _Does Todd exist?_ [I'm seated on the side of the stage.] William Lane Craig will provide an ontological argument in the affirmative based on the being and necessity of Todd. But we begin with Professor Richard Dawkins, who hopes to persuade us, _"There is no Todd."_

- Scandal in Hollywood! There's yet another celebrity sex scandal, and who's the culprit this time? Brace yourself ... it's actor Ryan Gosling! Thousands of women and several hundred men have come forward with complaints that he never once groped, propositioned, or otherwise behaved inappropriately towards them, despite the fact that they desperately wanted him to do so. There's even a hashtag, #MeThree, which was coined by a couple when Mr. Gosling declined their invitation to a ménage à trois.

- From the TechDesk: AI researchers at MIT's Media Lab have a team of robots that taught each other how to mime! [show a bot doing "the box" mime and two robots doing the "cowboy lasso" on the dance floor]
Sure, if a robot can pick up a jar of water and pour it into a cup, that's impressive. But what about a robot that can _pretend_ to do that? Science FTW!

- The USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) has reported a precipitous decline in immigration from Mexico. The reason? Potential immigrants are discovering that Americans are crazy AF. ... Unfortunately Ms. Diaz declined to be interviewed in San Diego, explaining that she would be less likely to perish in a mass shooting by staying in a safe city like Tijuana. She added, "I don't mind if the Mexican government funds Trump's border wall, so long as it keeps crazy Americans from getting into Mexico."

Mr. Trump was last seen being ushered by Secret Service to Pedro's Cantina for Morrisey karaoke night, where he received a standing ovation for his spirited but plaintive rendition of The Smith's _Este Hombre Encantador (This Charming Man)_.

- Life Imitates Art Department: Georgia Satellites' lead singer Dan Baird has been accused of sexual misconduct by his girlfriend/aspiring fiancé, who claims that although she told him, in terms unequivocal, "You ain't git no huggy an' no kissy 'til I git me a weddin' rang," he nevertheless began to huggy and kissy without first givin' her a weddin' rang. Fortunately Mr. Baird received sage counsel from ZZ Top frontman Billy Gibbons, who advised, "You ain't askin' for much. Oh Lord, take it downtown. You jus' lookin' for some tush." #MeeTew

He had identified has hairstyle as being natural and certainly not absurd at α=0.01 confidence after rejecting the null hypothesis, H<sub>0</sub> = The combover is completely ridiculous and isn't fooling anyone. ... He made another type I error by erroneously reporting that he looks good in a speedo, although he's obviously quite doughy with large love handles, even while obviously sucking it in. 

- Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones are auditioning drummers for a Led Zeppelin tribute band. In particular, drummers named Fred, since they hope to call themselves _Fred's Zeppelin_. Page conveyed the urgency of the situation: "We've already scheduled a gig as the opening act for Pub Quiz Night at _The Fox and Hounds Tavern & Grill_ in Shropshire, so we'd like to start practicing next week, ideally." They auditioned a drummer who was a perfect fit musically, but Fred (Micklewhite, of Kent) found a better gig with an 80's cover band that didn't involve playing with "a bunch of old geezers," as he put it. If _Fred's Zeppelin_ doesn't materialize, Page and Jones will begin auditioning rappers and DJs for a Led Zeppelin-themed hip-hop group called _Black Dawg_.

- Cybersecurity expert/recreational chemist/perennial fugitive John McAfee is hosting karaoke night at Zeena's Kool Spot (known locally as simply _La Barra_ for you non-gringos) in Santa Cruz, Belize every Thursday night at 9pm after dueling piano hour.

Be warned that the show may not start at 9pm sharp, since Mr. McAfee is perpetually under the influence of some combination of cocaine, methamphetamines, scotch, Juul, bath salts, MDMA, ayahuasca and home-brewed barbiturates. So it's customary for his karaoke show to begin late or even to not occur at all since he often fails to distinguish am from pm, what year it is, and which hemisphere of the planet he's on. (Some advice for anyone who performs at his karaoke night on the occasions when McAfee is lucid enough to host the show: if he asks whether you'd like to be accompanied by a rhythm section, decline; McAfee's so-called rhythm section is just his five teenaged girlfriends simultaneously playing Russian roulette.)

At press time, Mr. McAfee could be heard arhythmically mumbling an off-key version of Rupert Holmes' [Escape (the Piña Colada Song)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsj2wdFDmLk) from inside a dumpster behind a Tapas restaurant, where he had just awoken from a 17-hour drug induced coma following a 4 day stretch of drug induced wakefulness while he ensconced himself in a ditch under a cardboard box waiting for the FBI to finish searching his compound.

- Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson has announced that she intends to lose the Democratic nomination.
"Harness love ..." 
much less the Presidency itself.
The democrats which are polling best are those who are harnessing xenophobic fear in hopes of surfing a hate wave to Presidential victory, just as Trump did in 2016.

- Hispandering is the Dem's favorite new pastime. The first round of Democratic debates were marked by, in a (Spanish) word, _complaciendo_ (_pandering_). 

The democrats who fared best in post-debate polling were those who served the biggest plates of [_El Queso Grande_](https://time.com/3860269/late-night-with-david-letterman-merrill-markoe/), and Latinos/Latinas from coast to coast and north of Trump's still unbegun border wall were eating it up. 

, former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg now has a chance to [showcase his Spanish skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9KMgRamba0).

At press time, [Marianne Williamson](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/marianne-williamson-i-need-to-learn-spanish-by-tonight-at-9pm) could be overheard in her dressing room rehearsing the phrase, [Voy a aprovechar el amor para ganar esta elección](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JA6gYXEdwY) (_I'm going to harness love to win this election_).

- [Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI0rTtgbpRU) is now delivering all speeches, communiqués, emails, conversations, to-go orders, little-league pep chatter and phrases he screams while making love to his wife entirely in Spanish. When CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked Mr. O'Rourke about his linguistic switch, he replied, "Perdóneme señora, pero no hablo inglés."

- Trump reveals that his border wall policy had always been intended as a metaphor. Trump elaborated, "I'm sorry if that wasn't clear; I had thought my flights of poetic fancy were well-known enough that I obviously wasn't endeavoring to build a 3 billion cubic foot wall along the entire US/Mexico border, at least not in the literal sense of the phrase."

At press time, Mr. Trump was penning some purely fictional xenophebic vitriol in the form of a haiku.

- In an effort to distance himself from "socialistic sissies," referring to the centrist-leaning Democrats that are his competition for the Democratic Party nomination, Bernie Sanders is tattooing a portrait of Karl Marx on his forehead. 

- _Keeping up with the Rodriguezes_ To avoid being outshone by their Democratic colleagues, who are falling over each other to prove their Spanish speaking prowess, Republicans are now facing off with each other in Spanish-only rap battles. Donald Trump dispatched Jeb Bush before the contest had even officially begun with his rally cry, "Baja energía Jeb! (Low energy Jeb!)".

- Rock-n-roll philosophy
	- In ZZ Top's song _My Head's in Mississippi_, lead singer Billy Gibbons claims, "I was stumblin' through the parking lot of an invisible seven eleven." Now, if it was invisible, how did he know it was a 7-11 and not, say, a Circle K?
