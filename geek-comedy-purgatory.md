#### Geek purgatory: not purely intellectual, but then again not purely funny, so these ~~jokes~~ observations shall languish in geek comedy purgatory [IN PROGRESS]

- The phrase _vacuously true_ is used by mathematicians and others who are mathematically inclined, physicists for example, to indicate that a statement is technically true, but not in an earth-shattering sort of way. A common context is a proof in set theory which must handle the case of a theorem when it's applied to the empty set before moving on to more interesting cases, like [higher order infinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#Continuum_hypothesis). That reminds me, apropos [the controversy that we're leading to](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/entertainment/good-omens-petition-netflix-amazon-trnd/index.html), what did the NYC policeman say after the Crucifixion? "Alright, show's over people. Move along, nothin' to see here ..." But seriously folks,  vacuous cases can - paradoxically - cause considerable confusion. The reason being that any statement which is quantified over the empty set must be true (vacuously) because no counterexample could exist. The set is empty after all; it contains nothing and thus, [a fortiori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_a_fortiori), it contains no counterexample to any statement, however absurd that statement might be. For example, consider the statement,
> All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers.

At first blush, this sounds ridiculous. A number can't be even and odd at the same time. However, that's not what the statement says. There is just one even prime number, namely 2, so the set of all even prime numbers larger than 2 is the empty set. Thus the previous statement reduces to,

> Every member of the empty set is an odd number.

However pointless, that is a true statement. If you believe otherwise, then how would you disprove it? If you can find a member of the empty set that's not an odd number, then you have found a counterexample and you're done. But good luck with that since the empty set has no members at all, so in particular, it has no members about which one could say (truthfully or otherwise) "this is not an odd number." Therefore, the statement "All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers" is true, even if it isn't useful.

A good example of a vacuously true statement "in the wild" was [a tweet from _Netflix_ addressing a petition to cancel _Good Omens_](https://decider.com/2019/06/21/netflix-amazon-respond-good-omens-petition/). The petition was trivial to address. _Netflix_ can easily promise not to make another episode of _Good Omens_ for the (vacuously) true reason that _they never made an episode of it in the first place_ - [it's produced by __Amazon Prime__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMHTRFF)!

- Morrissey cancelled his sold-out concert in Los Angeles, CA upon finding out that the only reason the show sold out is that [he's extremely popular among Latinos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/08/why-do-mexican-americans-love-morrissey-so-much/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.14144eb64aa0). "I don't want to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to perform before throngs of adoring fans just because my angst-ridden lyrical and vocal style surprisingly resonates disproportiantely among Latinos. You should want me for who I am as a person." Concertgoers' concerns were not assuaged when it was announced that instead of issuing refunds, the show would go on as scheduled with headliner Ricky Martin. And yet more bad news in entertainment: David Hasselhoff has cancelled his Germany-only European Tour since the only reason he's so popular in Germany is that Germans are mysteriously enamored of David Hasselhoff.

- Doubling down! Amidst staunch criticism of President Trump's plan to build a "big, beautiful wall" along the 2000 mile border between the United States and Mexico

Although *Make America Great Again ** Again** then normal* sdfs

blah *one star **one more** back to one*

Although Mr. Trump's augmented wall/catapult policy is more unrealistic than the already impractal border wall plan which was the foundation of his previous campaign, poll results indicate that this new policy will lead Mr. Trump to an even more decisive victory in the 2020 election than the one he enjoyed in 2016.

- ***Rock the Primary!***

- The NSA and FBI have issued a joint security warning due to an ... which indicate that on February 14, 2020, hundreds of Mexicans are planning to cross the US border and steal Americans' hearts.

- Every year thousands of Mexicans cross the US border and steal jobs from American actors. Whether it . Even worse is Kate Castillo, or should I call her _Señorita Desvergonzada (Miss Shameless)_? 
she's horning in on American journalism as well.
Sean Penn could have interviewed El Chapo with help from an American like Cameron Diaz or John Quiñones\*. If we can't ensure that jobs which entail interviewing the most notorious living leader of a Mexican drug cartel are given to Americans, what hope have we for our economic future?

Every time Kate Castillo is cast in a Hollywood movie, she's taking roles that could have been portrayed by American actresses like Cameron Diaz and Selena Gomez. And for roles that are gender-neutral, American actors like Luis Guzmán, Danny Trujillo and Jimmy Smits. 

\* Fun Fact: [John Quiñones'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What_Would_You_Do%3F_(2008_TV_program)&_%28ABC_News_series%29=) Indian name is [_Hides with Cameras_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves).

- Rap music is running dangerously low on triplets. Although the triplet quota is nearly exhausted, there is still no consensus among rappers, producers and recording engineers on the best way to deal with the triplet shortage. Producer Rick Rubin has revealed that the initial mixes of Kendrick Lamar's forthcoming album _Tripless_ don't sound right, most likely because an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes was used everywhere that there otherwise would have been a quarter note triplet.

- Situations wanted: Seeking other musicians named Todd to join my _Led Zeppelin_ tribute band _Hammer of the Todds_.

- Tonight the Royal Institute of Philosophy will debate the following question, which is as incendiary as it is divisive: _Does Todd exist?_ [I'm seated on the side of the stage.] William Lane Craig will provide for the affirmative an ontological argument based on the being and necessity of Todd. But before Professor Craig offers his rebuttal, we begin with Professor Richard Dawkins, who hopes to persuade us of his negative claim, _"There is no Todd."_
