#### Geek purgatory: not purely intellectual, but then again not purely funny, so these ~~jokes~~ observations shall languish in geek comedy purgatory [IN PROGRESS]

- The phrase _vacuously true_ is used by mathematicians and others who are mathematically inclined, physicists for example, to indicate that a statement is technically true, but not in an earth-shattering sort of way. A common context is a proof in set theory which must handle the case of a theorem when it's applied to the empty set before moving on to more interesting cases, like [higher order infinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#Continuum_hypothesis). That reminds me, apropos [the controversy that we're leading to](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/entertainment/good-omens-petition-netflix-amazon-trnd/index.html), what did the NYC policeman say after the Crucifixion? "Alright, show's over people. Move along, nothin' to see here ..." But seriously folks,  vacuous cases can - paradoxically - cause considerable confusion. The reason being that any statement which is quantified over the empty set must be true (vacuously) because no counterexample could exist. The set is empty after all; it contains nothing and thus, [a fortiori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_a_fortiori), it contains no counterexample to any statement, however absurd that statement might be. For example, consider the statement,
> All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers.

At first blush, this sounds ridiculous. A number can't be even and odd at the same time. However, that's not what the statement says. There is just one even prime number, namely 2, so the set of all even prime numbers larger than 2 is the empty set. Thus the previous statement reduces to,

> Every member of the empty set is an odd number.

However pointless, that is a true statement. If you believe otherwise, then how would you disprove it? If you can find a member of the empty set that's not an odd number, then you have found a counterexample and you're done. But good luck with that since the empty set has no members at all, so in particular, it has no members about which one could say (truthfully or otherwise) "this is not an odd number." Therefore, the statement "All even primes larger than 2 are odd numbers" is true, even if it isn't useful.

A good example of a vacuously true statement "in the wild" was [a tweet from _Netflix_ addressing a petition to cancel _Good Omens_](https://decider.com/2019/06/21/netflix-amazon-respond-good-omens-petition/). The petition was trivial to address. _Netflix_ can easily promise not to make another episode of _Good Omens_ for the (vacuously) true reason that _they never made an episode of it in the first place_ - [it's produced by __Amazon Prime__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMHTRFF)!

- Morrissey cancelled his sold-out concert in Los Angeles, CA upon finding out that the only reason the show sold out is that [he's extremely popular among Latinos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/08/why-do-mexican-americans-love-morrissey-so-much/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.14144eb64aa0). "I don't want to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to perform before throngs of adoring fans just because my lyrical and vocal style surprisingly resonates disproportiantely among Latinos. You should want me for who I am as a person." Concertgoers' concerns were not assuaged when it was announced that instead of issuing refunds, the show would go on as scheduled with headliner Ricky Martin.

- Doubling down! Amidst staunch criticism of President Trump's plan to build a "big, beautiful wall" along the 2000 mile border between the United States and Mexico

blah *one star **one more** back to one*

Although Mr. Trump's augmented wall/catapult policy is more unrealistic than the already impractal border wall plan which was the foundation of his previous campaign, poll results indicate that this new policy will lead Mr. Trump to an even more decisive victory in the 2020 election than the one he enjoyed in 2016.

- ***Rock the Primary!***

- The NSA and FBI have issued a joint security warning due to an ... which indicate that on February 14, 2020, hundreds of Mexicans are planning to cross the US border and steal Americans' hearts.

- Every year thousands of Mexicans cross the US border and steal jobs from American actors. Whether it . Even worse is Kate Castillo, or should I call her _Se√±orita Desvergonzada (Miss Shameless)_? 
she's horning in on American journalism as well.
Sean Penn could have been interviewing _El Chapo_ with help from an American like Cameron Diaz. If we can't ensure that jobs which involve interviewing the most notorious living leader of a Mexican drug cartel are given to Americans, what hope have we for our economic future?
