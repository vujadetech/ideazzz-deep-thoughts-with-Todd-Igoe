# Recursion IRL (i.e., recursion in real life)

#### Beastie Boys
The lyric to the first song, "Jimmy James," from the Beastie Boys album [*Check Your Head*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIII1-jKJeY&t=267s) begins like this:	
> This next one is the first song on our new album.

But _Check Your Head_ **is** their new album.
	
#### 30 Rock
 _30 Rock_ episode [_Queen of Jordan_](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/05fb0549-ce6a-451e-86c7-6a34195c75b1)  has a schema for proving the undecidability of Peano arithmetic. 
> My single, "My Single is Dropping," is dropping.

At least it seems like it should be possible since it's a specific instance of the more general recursive form

>x "x y" y
