# Recursion IRL (i.e., recursion in real life)

- The lyric to the first song, "Jimmy James," from the Beastie Boys album [*Check Your Head*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIII1-jKJeY&t=267s) begins like this:	
> This next one is the first song on our new album.

	But _Check Your Head_ **is** their new album.
	
- _30 Rock_ episode [_Queen of Jordan_](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/05fb0549-ce6a-451e-86c7-6a34195c75b1)  has a schema for proving the undecidability of Peano arithmetic. 
> My single, "My Single is Dropping," is dropping.

	At least it seems like it should be possible since it's a specific instance of the more general recurisive form "x 'x y' y".
	
- [The wikipedia article on recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) has more well-known examples.
